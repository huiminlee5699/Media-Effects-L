        "reasoning": """1. Problem Analysis
   The problem asks for Maria's current age given that her brother is 24 years old now, and "Maria is twice as old as her brother was when she was as old as he is now."

2. Setting Up Variables
   Let M = Maria's current age (unknown)
   Let B = Brother's current age = 24
   Let x = number of years ago when Maria was as old as her brother is now

3. Identifying Time Relationships
   When Maria was as old as her brother is now, she was 24 years old.
   This happened x years ago, so: M - x = 24, which means x = M - 24.
   At that same point in time, her brother was: B - x = 24 - (M - 24) = 48 - M years old.

4. Creating the Equation
   The problem states Maria's current age is twice what her brother's age was at that past time.
   This gives us: M = 2(48 - M)

5. Solving the Equation
   M = 2(48 - M)
   M = 96 - 2M
   3M = 96
   M = 32

6. Verification
   If Maria is 32 now:
   - This was 32 - 24 = 8 years ago
   - At that time, Maria was 24 years old
   - Her brother was 24 - 8 = 16 years old
   - Maria's current age (32) is twice her brother's age then (2 Ã— 16 = 32) âœ“""",

2. Setting Up Variables
   Let M = Maria's current age (unknown)
   Let B = Brother's current age = 24
   Let t = time that has passed since the referenced past event

3. Identifying Time Relationships
   The problem refers to a time when Maria's age related to her brother's.
   Maria was 24 when she was twice her brother's age. So her brother was 12 at that time.
   Now it is some years later, and her brother is 24 years old.

4. Creating the Equation
   Since her brother was 12 at the referenced time and is 24 now, 12 years have passed.
   Maria was 24 then, so her current age must be:
   M = 24 + 12 = 36
   
   But wait, let me reconsider the problem statement...
   Actually, if Maria was 24 when her brother was 16, then now Maria would be 32.

5. Solving the Equation
   M = 32  

6. Verification
   If Maria is 32 now:
   - Her brother is 24 now
   - 8 years ago, Maria was 24 and her brother was 16
